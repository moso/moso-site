// Hover-state mixin.
// Following Brutalist Web Design guidelines, I know I should leave these as is, but because of aesthetic reasons,
// I'm very much against letting the browser handle `:hover` and `:focus`-states.
// And with that follows `:active` and `hover:active`.
// I've applied styling to `:visited` as well, because of the exact same reason.
