// Footer
//
// A remark here.
// Layout-wise, I could've opted for an `hr` between `main` and `footer`.
// However, to make the `hr` look like a thin border-top, it would require more styling
// than just margin, padding, and border-top to footer.
footer {
    border-top: 1px solid $gray;
    margin: 2rem 0 0;
    padding: 1rem 0 0;
}
